Welcome to the seventh newsletter from **Security Without Borders**. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

> **Security Tip** Social media plays an important role in many activist communities and is widely used by journalists, thus making an account hijack rather far more than embarrassing to deal with. The usual advice on using creating strong, unique passwords and combining it with [two-factor authentication](https://theoutline.com/post/2489/two-passwords-are-always-better-than-one) applies, an often forgotten risk is formed by third-party apps that have access to the accounts. A [website](https://www.permissions.review/) has been set up that helps you find out which third-party apps have access to your various accounts. Remove access by any app you don't regularly use, or that doesn't provide actual benefits to your usage of the accounts.
